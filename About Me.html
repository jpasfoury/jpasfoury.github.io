				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>
			    I am really new into the Computer Science space as this is first semester in the program. I have gone to college before once as a undecided student just taking prerequisites while I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. The second time around I was in the HVAC program at Wake Tech learning how to install and maintain a HVAC system. Joining the HVAC program at Wake Tech was not my first choice but I didn't have too good of an idea of what I wanted to study so I figured it was better than doing nothing. Computer Science is something I started to think about studying this past summer and after alot of research and alot of thinking I felt like it was the best path for me. Getting to study something I am interested in while also setting myself up for a good future is an amazing feeling I haven't ever felt up until this point in my life.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				<p>
			    I am a person who can work alone but who also loves to work as a member of a team. I am talkative and socialable but also have the ability to "get in the zone" when needed high levels of concentration when working on detailed work like programming or designing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
